# Welcome

You can access the page index at any time by clicking the <span class="hamburger"></span> icon in the upper left of the page.

As a new user, [the getting started guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/intro/getting-started.html) is a good place to start, then perhaps moving on to [the FAQ](/users/faq.html). If
you run into trouble getting devices to connect to each other,
[Network & Firewalls]({{ site.baseurl }}/users/firewalls.html) explain the networking necessary to get it to work.

As a developer looking to get started with a contribution, see [how to build Syncthing]({{ site.baseurl }}/dev/building.html), [debugging]({{ site.baseurl }}/dev/debugging.html) and the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). This documentation site can be [edited here](https://github.com/syncthing/docs).
