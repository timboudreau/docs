Syncthing uses a single directory to store configuration, crypto keys and index caches. The location defaults to `~/.config/syncthing` (Unixes), `%AppData%/Syncthing` (Windows XP), `%localappdata%/Syncthing` (Windows 7/8) or `~/Library/Application Support/Syncthing` (Mac) but is also settable at runtime using the `-home` flag. In this directory you'll generally see something like the following files:

* `cert.pem`: The device's RSA public key, named "cert" for legacy reasons.
* `key.pem`: The device's RSA private key. This needs to be protected.
* `config.xml`: The configuration file, in XML format.
* `https-cert.pem` and `https-key.pem`: The certificate and key for HTTPS GUI connections.
* `index/`: A directory holding the database with metadata and hashes of the files currently on disk and available from peers.
* `csrftokens.txt`: A list of recently issued CSRF tokens (for protection against browser cross site request forgery).

# Config File Format

The following is an example default configuration file:

```xml
<configuration version="2">
    <folder id="default" directory="/Users/jb/Sync" ro="false" ignorePerms="false">
        <device id="GXN5ECCWTA2B7EB5FXYL5OWGOADX5EF5VNJAQSIBAY6XHJ24BNOA"></device>
    </folder>
    <device id="GXN5ECCWTA2B7EB5FXYL5OWGOADX5EF5VNJAQSIBAY6XHJ24BNOA" name="jborg-mbp">
        <address>dynamic</address>
    </device>
    <gui enabled="true" tls="true">
        <address>127.0.0.1:54096</address>
        <user>jb</user>
        <password>$2a$10$EKaTIcpz2...</password>
        <apikey>O80CDOJ9LVUVCMHFK2OJDO4T882735</apikey>
    </gui>
    <options>
        <listenAddress>:54097</listenAddress>
        <globalAnnounceServer>announce.syncthing.net:22025</globalAnnounceServer>
        <globalAnnounceEnabled>true</globalAnnounceEnabled>
        <localAnnounceEnabled>true</localAnnounceEnabled>
        <parallelRequests>16</parallelRequests>
        <maxSendKbps>0</maxSendKbps>
        <rescanIntervalS>60</rescanIntervalS>
        <reconnectionIntervalS>60</reconnectionIntervalS>
        <maxChangeKbps>10000</maxChangeKbps>
        <startBrowser>true</startBrowser>
        <upnpEnabled>true</upnpEnabled>
        <urAccepted>0</urAccepted>
    </options>
</configuration>
```

The following sections should be present in a well formed config file.

## configuration

The root element.

### Attributes

* `version`: The config version. `2` is current.

## folder

One or more `folder` elements must be present in the file. Each element describes one folder.

Within the `folder` element one or more `device` element should be present. These must contain the `id` attribute and nothing else. Mentioned devices are those that will be sharing the folder in question. Each mentioned device must have a separate `device` element later in the file. It is customary that the local device ID is included in all repositories. Syncthing will currently add this automatically if it is not present in the configuration file.

### Attributes

* `id`: The folder ID, must be unique. (mandatory)
* `directory`: The directory where the folder is stored on this device; not sent to other devices. (mandatory)
* `ro`: True if the folder is read only (will not be modified by syncthing) on this device. (optional, defaults to `false`)
* `ignorePerms`: True if the folder should [ignore permissions](http://forum.syncthing.net/t/v0-8-10-ignore-permissions/263).

### Children

* One or mode `device` elements.

## device

One or more `device` elements must be present in the file. Each element describes a device participating in the cluster. It is customary to include a `device` element for the local device; syncthing will currently add one if it is not present.

### Attributes

* `id`: The device ID. This must be written in canonical form, that is without any spaces or dashes. (mandatory)
* `name`: A friendly name for the device. (optional)

### Children

* One or mode `address` elements.

## address

The address section is only valid inside of `device` elements. It contains a single address, on one of the following forms:

* IPv4 addresses, IPv6 addresses within brackets, or DNS names, all optionally followed by a port number.
* `dynamic`: The address will be resolved using discovery.

## gui

There must be exactly one `gui` element.

### Attributes

* `enabled`: `true`/`false`
* `tls`: `true`/`false` - if true then the GUI will use HTTPS

### Children

* `address`: One or more address elements must be present, containing an `ip:port` listen address.
* `username` and `password`: Set to require authentication. `password` contains the bcrypt hash of the real password.
* `apikey`: If set, this is the API key that enables usage of the [REST interface]().

## options

There must be exactly one `options` element. It contains the following configuration settings as children;

* `listenAddress`&nbsp;: `host:port` or `:port` string denoting an address to listen for BEP (sync protocol) connections. More than one `listenAddress` may be given. (default `0.0.0.0:22000`)

* `globalAnnounceServer`&nbsp;: `host:port` where a global announce server may be reached. (default `announce.syncthing.net:22025Â´)

* `globalAnnounceEnabled`: `true`/`false` (default `true`)

* `localAnnounceEnabled`: `true`/`false` (default `true`)

* `parallelRequests`: The maximum number of outstanding block requests to have against any given peer. (default `16`)

* `maxSendKbps`: Rate limit

* `rescanIntervalS`: The number of seconds to wait between each scan for modification of the local repositories. (default `60`) A value of 0 disables the scanner.

* `reconnectionIntervalS`: The number of seconds to wait between each attempt to connect to currently unconnected devices. (default `60`)

* `maxChangeKbps`: The maximum rate of change allowed for a single file. When this rate is exceeded, further changes to the file are not announced, until the rate is reduced below the limit. (default `10000`)

* `startBrowser`: `true`/`false` (default `true`)

* `upnpEnabled`: `true`/`false` (default `true`)

* `urAccepted`: Whether the user as accepted to submit anonymous usage data. The default, `0`, mean the user has not made a choice, and syncthing will ask at some point in the future. `-1` means no, `1` means yes.
