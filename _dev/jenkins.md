title: Jenkins CI

Jenkins will test pull requests from recognized authors. If the pull request
is not from a recognized author, an *admin* needs to tell Jenkins to perform
the tests, after giving the patch a manual look over to prevent shenanigans. A
number of tests are performed, ranging from verifying correct code formatting
and that the author is included in the AUTHORS file to that the code in fact
builds and passes tests. A pull request should usually only be merged if all
tests return green, although there are exceptions.

To enable testing for this pull request only:

```
@st-jenkins ok to test
```

To enable testing for this pull request, and all future pull requests from the same author:

```
@st-jenkins add to whitelist
```

For pull requests where Jenkins has already run it's tests, but should run them again:

```
@st-jenkins test this please
```

This is not necessary when new commits are pushed (tests will be rerun for the new commits), but is useful if something has changed server side or to verify that everything is still OK if `master` has been updated.
