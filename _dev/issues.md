title: Issue Management
---

Bugs, feature requests and other things we need to do are tracked as Github issues. Issues can be of various types and in various states, and also belong to milestones or not. This page is an attempt to document the current practice.

## Labels

Issues without labels are undecided - that is, we don't yet know if it's a bug, a configuration issue, a feature request or what. Issues that are invalid for whatever reason are closed with a short explanation of why. Examples include "Duplicate of #123", "Discovered to be configuration error", "Rendered moot by #123" and so on. We don't use the "invalid" or "wontfix" labels.

- **android** - Marks an issue as occurring on the Android platform only.

- **bug** - The issue is a verified bug.

- **build** - The issue is caused by or requires changes to the build system (scripts or Docker image).

- **docs** - Something requires documenting.

- **easy** - This could be easily fixed, probably an hours work or less.

- **enhancement** - This is a new feature or an improvement of some kind, as opposed to a problem (bug).

- **help-wanted** - The core team can't or won't do this, but someone else is welcome to. This does not mean that help is not wanted on the *other* issues. You can see this as a soft `wontfix`.

- **pr-bugfix** - This pull request *fixes* a bug. This is different from the `bug` label, as there may also be pull requests with for example tests that *prove* a bug which would then be labeled `bug`.

- **pr-refactor** - This pull request is a refactoring, i.e. not supposed to change behavior.

- **pr-wait-or-pending** - This pull request is not ready for merging, even if the tests pass and it looks good. It is incomplete or requires more discussion.

- **protocol** - This requires a change to the protocol.
