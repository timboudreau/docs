Request immediate rescan of a folder, or a specific path within a folder. Takes the mandatory parameter `folder` (folder ID) and the optional parameter `sub` (path relative to the folder root). If `sub` is omitted or empty, the entire folder is scanned for changes, otherwise only the given path (and children, in case it's a directory) is scanned.

Requesting scan of a path that no longer exists, but previously did, is valid and will result in syncthing noticing the deletion of the path in question.

Returns status 200 and no content upon success, or status 500 and a plain text error if an error occurred during scanning.

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8384/rest/db/scan?folder=default&sub=foo/bar
```
